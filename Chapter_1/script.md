# IN THIS CHAPTER
  - you learn binary search, your first search algorithm
  - big O notation
  - techniques for solving problems.\

> [!NOTE]
 algorithms can be used to learn GPS tracking and AI algorithms that can play XO.
> algorithms can be for AI, databases, and so on. not generally. well, there are general algorithms ofc.

*simple/linear search* (maybe stupid search) is going through each number in the list. and it takes O(n) as we go through every element preceeding the requested one in order to reach it.

with binary search, you guess the middle number and eliminate the rest. It takes O(log n).

***Binary search works only and ONLY when a list is sorted.***

**Binary search does not return the element but the index. If no element was found, return None**
